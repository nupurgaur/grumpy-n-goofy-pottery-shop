                  Started in a tiny studio with clay-covered hands and a big dream, 
                  Grumpy 'n' Goofy brings you pottery that's anything but ordinary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We believe that functional art should make you smile - whether you're 
                  a grumpy morning person reaching for your coffee mug or a goofy soul 
                  who finds joy in the little things.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each piece is lovingly shaped, fired, and finished by hand, carrying 
                  with it the imperfections that make it perfectly unique.
